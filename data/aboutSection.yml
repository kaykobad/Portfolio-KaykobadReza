  ### Your satisfaction is my ultimate priority

  With 4+ years of experience in applications development for international companies 
  (like Samsung and bKash) with different technologies like Android, iOS, MVC, REST, Django, GraphQL, 
  and finally now with Flutter and Firebase, I am here to help you build applications according to 
  your ideas that can outstand your business or write computer programs to help you accomplish your goal.    
  I will keep you up to date about the work in progress until we reach the final product you needed 
  in the first place, maybe even better.
