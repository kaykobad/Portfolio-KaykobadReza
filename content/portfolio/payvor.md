##### How it works

**Post a job/task for free:** Tell us what you need and set the price you are willing to pay for the job.     

**Helpers come to you:** The members that are a good fit for the job will apply to your favor.     

**Select the helper you like:** The applicants will be waiting for your decision in the applicant zone. Select the best candidate for the job. Chat with the applicants and hire the one that is the best match for the task.     

**Collaborate:** The task will be completed by the helper and you will be notified.     

**Payment and rating:** Once the task has been completed, you can release the payment through our secure online platform. Both of you get to rate each other on the collaboration and leave a comment for future members to see.
