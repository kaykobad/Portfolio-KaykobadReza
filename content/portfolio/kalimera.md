#### Overview
One of my clients from Greece asked me if I could help him build an app that works as a tourist guide to the visitors of Kos in Greece. He said, "The app needs to be on both platforms(Android & iOS) and should deliver the best experience to the tourists."

The challenge was to build a tourist app on both Android and iOS which will deliver the best experience to it's users. The app should not only be fast and smooth but it should also be loaded with lots of cool features along with real time data reload, push notifications, events, user analytics, location tracking and much more!

#### Look what the owner says about the app:
> Kalimera app connects Kos’ visitors with the local experience they deserve. We aim to offer you the best experience possible and the most beautiful memories to take back home from the most popular spots to the best-hidden gems.
> Kalimera is derived from the Greek words "καλή" and "ημέρα" which translates to Good Day, and that's what we at Kalimera app strive to achieve for our users, for them to have a good day.
