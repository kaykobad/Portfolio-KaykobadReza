With regular challenges, you'll always be motivated. Keep a log of your time and distance covered, track your stats. Stay fit and save money.
challenge: The challenge was to build a fitness app that keeps track of time, distance, pace and activity of a user while running walking. The app should track location and activity in the background and throttle illegal use of vehicle/bike during a run and warn the user to be fair while completing a challenge.
solution: To solve these problems, I built an app named “Dorao” in which user can run with a traget or select and complete challenge to get reward. Used activity monitoring api to detect whether user is running or using any vehicle to complete any challenge. The app tracks activity, route and location in the background.
