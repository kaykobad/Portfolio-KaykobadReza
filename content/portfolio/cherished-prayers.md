shortDescription: Cherished Prayers App lets the user record the prayers according to his requirements. There is one main person who is handling the working of this project, that is the admin. He needs to login into his account. The added people are able to post in case of any problem regarding prayer and the people who will be reading this post may respond if they know the solution of that problem. The user is also given an opportunity to provide rating, complains, feedback and suggestions about the experience with application.
challenge: In today’s world, people are getting away from the God and they do not offer prayers. The people who want to offer prayers must face a lot of difficulties as they do not know the proper methods and note which they must speak while offering the prayer. Moreover, there are a lot of people who have a lot of questions about the verses and the prayer methods and they hesitate to ask someone. Those who ask may have to put some effort for asking as they must search Imam for it. Moreover, the knowledge of people in this world is very limited for religion.
solution: To solve these problems, I built an app named “Cherished Prayers” in which user will have an advantage of setting a proper verse for all the people within a group. Moreover, the user can also leave a prayer note for his family. All the communication between the user and his friends will take place in chat box. Feed is basically the post and comment section in the application. The system will also focus on the customer feedback and the response of the admin in time for the sake of customer satisfaction due to which trust will be developed between the user and the admin.

#### Overview
In today’s world, people are getting away from the God and they do not offer prayers. The people who want to offer prayers must face a lot of difficulties as they do not know the proper methods and note which they must speak while offering the prayer. Moreover, there are a lot of people who have a lot of questions about the verses and the prayer methods and they hesitate to ask someone. Those who ask may have to put some effort for asking as they must search Imam for it. Moreover, the knowledge of people in this world is very limited for religion.

To solve these problems, I built a system named “Cherished Prayers System” in which user will have an advantage of setting a proper verse for all the people within the group. This system will ensure the timely praying of a lot of people. The first thing that this system does right away is to let the user record prayers and set notification or a reminder for that prayer. The user will then be having an advantage to offer that prayer by using the application. Moreover, the user can also leave a prayer note for his family in the same section. All the communication between the user and his friends will take place in chat box. Feed is basically the post and comment section in the application. The system will also focus on the customer feedback and the response of the admin in time for the sake of customer satisfaction due to which trust will be developed between the user and the admin.

There are many such applications which already exist but with some cons. The existing apps are very expensive and are not easily available. Moreover, the user isn’t given any opportunity to provide the feedback. I implemented this system to remove all these problems.

I took this awesome opportunity to build this very useful app. I built "Cherished Prayers App" with Flutter as a cross platform mobile framework and Django as the backend. Flutter gives the native performance and experience while Django provides us with all the services related to backend of the app. I used Firebase for implementing realtime chat functionality.
